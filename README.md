# ClubOS-Automated-Texting
Client for The Edge Fitness Clubs to automate texting

This project was made as a proof of concept for The Edge while I was employed as a Sales Specialist.
After being asked to not use the program I halted all updates but this program does work as intended after packaging.

This project utilizes:
  Electron
  Vite
  React.js
  typescript
  
Learning how to utilize vite and electron together was a bit of a challenge but it was one I welcomed with open arms,
with the main thought of avoiding the tedious task of our sales texts we are supposed to send daily.

After around a week of intermittent coding this was the final project. If you would like to use the program I encourage it.
If you make an issue request I will explain the config.json file that it is missing.
